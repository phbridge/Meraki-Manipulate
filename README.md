Until provision of alcohol or baked goodies your on your own but there is no rocket science involved so don't panic too
much. To accept this EULA you must include the correct flag when running the script. If this script goes crazy wrong and
breaks everything then your also on your own and Phil will not accept any liability of any type or kind. As this script
belongs to Phil and NOT Cisco then Cisco cannot be held responsible for its use or if it goes bad, nor can Cisco make
any profit from this script. Phil can profit from this script but will not assume any liability. Other than the boring
stuff please enjoy and plagiarise as you like (as I have no ways to stop you) but common curacy says to credit me in some
way [see above comments on Beer, Wine, Steak and Greggs.].
